This is an upgraded version of the college application that uses Java FX and connects to a MySQL server.

It is assumed that you have a root MySQL account with the password "PASSWORD". 

You will find scripts to create the book table, as well as to populate it. 

You will be required to create the database yourself with a simple "create database library" statement.

If you have any questions, let me know and I will help you.
